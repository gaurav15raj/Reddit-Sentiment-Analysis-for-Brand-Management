# Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Brand-Management

This project was part of the course SOC471 : Computational Sociology, as an endeavour to emloy big data for various uses. Our group decided to use Reddit, a popular online platform, to perform sentiment analysis for various brands. The code provides a customisable brand and subreddit placeholder, using which customers can feed in the brand they are seeking to analyse as well as the subreddit on which they feel the brand is most talked about. A good example would be Zerodha on r/IndianStockMarket. 

All further details are elaborated in the project report. Please make sure to use your own login credentials while using the code provided. This can be generated wasily by logging in as a dev on Reddit and creating an app. 

Note : For anyone wondering, we did not use twitter (now X) as Twitter's recent policies have made it difficult to read more than 300 tweets a day.
